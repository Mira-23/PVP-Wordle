# PVP Wordle
A variation of wordle created using python

How to use:
1. Launch server (either the exe in dist/ or from server/main.py from the github repo)
2. Launch 2 clients (either from the exe in dist or from client/wordle.py, for testing only - just on one device)
3. Play!

Notes:
Currently the compiled setup only works on localhost, as hooking up the actual database and server
(to Neon DB and etc) cannot be done in a compiled state
